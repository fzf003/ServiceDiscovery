replace ServiceDiscovery app.run response with this:
#####
var serviceData = await serviceRegistry.GetServiceInstanceAsync("Service.Data");
var response = $"hello, world from {manager.ServiceName} @ {manager.ServiceAddress}:{manager.ServicePort} using Service.Data: {serviceData.ID}";
#####

1. Reload DataService
2. Run a few instances of DataService
3. Verify in Consul that they are registered
4. Run a few instances of ServiceDiscovery.exe
5. go to http://localhost:9999/api/ and see the response and how the ports rotate.
